# Reflection 
Building my website using GitHub was an insightful experience that taught me both technical and project management skills. I gained hands-on experience with GitHub Pages, version control, and basic web development, which helped me better understand how to create and deploy a live website. This process improved my confidence in managing code and working with online tools.

# Challenges Faced and Solutions
One of the biggest challenges was getting familiar with Git and GitHub commands, especially pushing changes and resolving merge conflicts. Initially, I accidentally overwrote some files and struggled with the command line interface. To overcome this, I followed tutorials on Git basics and practiced regularly, which helped me become more comfortable with version control. Another challenge was customizing the website design using HTML, CSS, and sometimes JavaScript. I found it difficult to implement some layout features, so I used online resources like documentation and forums, and tested different approaches until I achieved the desired look.

# Future Improvements
Moving forward, I plan to improve my website by making it more interactive and visually appealing with enhanced CSS animations and responsive design for better mobile usability. I also want to integrate more content sections to showcase projects in detail, including live demos or links to source code. Additionally, I aim to streamline my Git workflow, perhaps by using GUI tools alongside the command line for better efficiency and reducing errors.
